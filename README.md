## 📝 Design Notes (V2)

### Intentional Quirk: The Streak Counter
Most calculator tools are cold and transactional. I added a session streak counter that tracks consecutive calculations. Why? Because even boring tools can have personality. The streak serves no "business purpose"—it's just a small dopamine hit to make math feel a bit more fun. It resets when you refresh. Impermanent, like a good cup of coffee.

### Tradeoff: Keyboard Shortcuts Over Mobile-First
I added ⌘+Enter to calculate and ? for help. This prioritizes desktop power users over mobile thumb-typers. The tradeoff: mobile users don't get the "pro" experience. But honestly? This is a calculator for people who use keyboards. The mobile layout works fine; it just doesn't have shortcuts. Choose your user.

### What I Chose NOT to Build
No persistent cloud storage. Your history lives in localStorage and vanishes when you clear data. No accounts, no sync, no "save to cloud." The decision: this is a browser tool, not a database application. If you need permanent records, export to a real spreadsheet. This tool does one thing well: quick calculations that disappear when you're done.

## 🎉 Additional Features (V3)

Five major enhancements for advanced data utility:

### 1. Enhanced Visualization Graphs
**Why added**: The original bar chart was basic and limited.

**What changed**: Upgraded to interactive Recharts with:
- Hover tooltips showing exact values
- Color-coded bars for better visual distinction
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Smooth animations on data changes

### 2. Favorites System
**Why added**: Users frequently calculate the same ranges (e.g., 1-100, 1-365 for days).

**What changed**: Added a favorites panel where you can:
- Save any range configuration with a custom name
- Quickly load saved ranges with one click
- Manage up to 20 favorite ranges
- Organize frequently-used calculations

### 3. Export to CSV/PDF
**Why added**: Users need to save results for reports or analysis.

**What changed**: Added comprehensive export options:
- **CSV Export**: Download full calculation history as spreadsheet
- **Print Report**: Generate beautifully formatted PDF reports
- **Include History**: Export includes all recent calculations
- **One-Click**: Single button to download or print

### 4. Custom Formula Builder
**Why added**: Power users want to apply custom mathematical operations.

**What changed**: Added a formula editor that supports:
- Create custom mathematical expressions
- Define variables with default values
- Test formulas before saving
- Support for: sin, cos, tan, sqrt, abs, pow, PI, E
- Save and reuse custom formulas

### 5. Shareable Links
**Why added**: Collaboration requires sharing configurations easily.

**What changed**: Added share functionality:
- Generate unique URLs for any range configuration
- Copy link with one click
- Anyone opening the link sees your exact settings
- Perfect for sharing calculations with colleagues

### Intentionally Rejected: Cloud Sync
I considered adding cloud storage for favorites and history. Rejected because:
- This is a privacy-focused tool—your calculations stay on your device
- localStorage is sufficient for most use cases
- Export to CSV covers the "backup" use case
- No account overhead means instant access, no login friction
